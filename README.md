# Objective
The objective of this project is to build a simple, menu-driven Student Management System that allows secure login and basic management of student details (ID, Name, Age, Grade) using a CSV file for data storage. It aims to replace manual record-keeping with an easy, text-based interface that supports adding, viewing, updating, searching, and deleting student records.

# Features
- Login system with fixed admin credentials.
- Add new student records with unique Student IDs.
- List all student records in a readable format.
- Search for a student by Student ID.
- Update an existing student’s Name, Age, or Grade.
- Delete a student record by Student ID.
- Persistent storage using students.csv so data is saved between runs.
- Simple, menu-driven command-line interface.

# Tools Used
- Platform: Google Colab or your local computer
- Language: Python 3
- Editor: VS Code or any text editor
- Modules: csv, os (standard library)

# How to Run
- Install Python 3 from python.org.
- Install VS Code or any editor of your choice.
- Save the project as student_management.py.
- Open a terminal, navigate to the project folder, and run:
  python student_management.py
You can also test in Google Colab by pasting code in a notebook cell and running it.

# Testing Instructions
- Log in with username admin, password password.
- Try all menu options: add students, list them, search by ID, update, and delete.
- Check that changes persist by running the program again and listing students.
