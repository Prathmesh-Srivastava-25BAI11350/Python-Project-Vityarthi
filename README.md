# Python-Project-Vityarthi

### Problem Statement  
The project is a simple command-line Student Management System that helps store and manage basic student details (ID, name, age, grade) using a CSV file. It solves the problem of manually maintaining student records by allowing easy viewing, searching, adding, updating, and deleting of records in a persistent way.

### Scope of Variables  
- `F`: Stores the CSV filename that holds all student records.  
- `students` / `stu`: A list of dictionaries, each dictionary representing one student’s data.  
- Local variables like `S_ID`, `n`, `ag`, `gr`, `ch`, `flag`: Used inside functions to hold user inputs and control menu choices or search results.

### Targeted Users  
- School or college staff who need a simple tool to manage a small set of student records.  
- First-year programming students who want to understand file handling, lists, and basic CRUD operations in Python.

### Features  
- Login system with a fixed admin username and password.  
- Add new student records with unique Student ID.  
- List all stored students in a formatted way.  
- Search for a student by Student ID.  
- Update an existing student’s name, age, or grade.  
- Delete a student record by Student ID.  
- Automatic saving of changes to a CSV file for data persistence.
